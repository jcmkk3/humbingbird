#+title: üê¶ trochilidae

A from-scratch re-creation of the [[https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird][Hummingbird keyboard]] using ergogen

*** Features
- Same key layout as my latest rufous splay unibody
- Meant for tented/puck usage
- MCU footprint to allow both controllers to be component side up
- Reset pads for easy tweezering
- Battery wire window in case you want to run the wires under the board (should be nice for builds with a case)
- A couple of holes for header pins meant to be used with a physical jumper to disconnect power if needed
