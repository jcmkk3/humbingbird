*** Features
- Same key layout as my latest rufous splay unibody
- Meant for tented/puck usage
- MCU footprint to allow both controllers to be component side up
- Reset pads for easy tweezering
- Battery wire window in case you want to run the wires under the board (should be nice for builds with a case)
- A couple of holes for header pins meant to be used with a physical jumper to disconnect power if needed

** Possible Future Variants
- Rectangular variant with side mounted MCU and USB port facing the side, intended for use on top of an existing laptop keyboard
- Choc mini/choc v1 pinky hybrid variant
- Deconstructed 3D-ish variant with negative sloping main keys flat thumbs and pinky keys with reverse slope of main board
- Split variant
- Wireless variant(s)
- Scooped keycap spaced (18x18)
