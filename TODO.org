- Add switch footprints that include the diode in the correct position and have it already pre-routed within the switch
- Add MCU footprint that includes pre-routing for the pins that need to be accessed from the opposite side of the MCU
- Add a tray case to the ergogen configuration 
- Investigate and add a license to the repo
- Custom footprints
  - Investigate how best to package them outside of just having a forked ergogen repo
  - Footprints
    - Switches (with pre-routing)
    - MCU (with pre-routing)
    - Mounting holes (smaller than ergogen provided)
    - Silkscreen art
