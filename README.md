# trochilidae
A from-scratch re-creation of the [Hummingbird keyboard](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird) using ergogen

## The Family
### Rufous
*Selasphorus rufus*

This board is the basis of all other boards in this repo. It is modeled after the original hummingbird.

### Berylline
*Saucerottia beryllina*

This board features some adjustments to the key placement from the Rufous
- A slight increase in angle between the halves 23 -> 25 degrees
- 3 degrees of splay between pinky and ring columns
- 2 degrees of splay between ring and middle columns
- Slightly increased stagger for all columns
- Thumb keys are moved slightly towards the center
